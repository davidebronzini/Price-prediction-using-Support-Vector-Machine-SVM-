# Price-prediction-using-Support-Vector-Machine-SVM-
The objective of the study is the prediction by binary classification of a stock price movement with application of support vector machine (SVM) technique.

N1 (stock price features): 5, 10, 20, 90, 270 days
N2 (index-based features): 5, 10, 20, 90, 270 days
Prediction period length (M): 1, 5, 10, 20, 90, 270 days
